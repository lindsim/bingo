//generate board with default length squares
//set middle square to free


//new board when length changes
//new board when new board button length selected -- are you sure if current board is in play

//choose square color
//choose stamp color
//choose stamp shape


//stamp - click to stamp
//click again to erase stamp

//check for winning by checking adjacent stamps in row until one is not stamped
//check for winning by checking stamps above/below until one is not stamped
//check of stamps in diagonal sets until one is not stamped

//how to store stamp/not stamp value to elminate extra comparisons - r
//start with 0, 0 as current check point
//then go to 0, 1 etc
// start with 0, 0, go to 1, 0 
//get row of values; if false in row, return
//if no false in row, return BINGO
//get column of values; if false in column, return
//if no false in column, return BINGO
//check diagonal 1
//check diagonal 2
//if checking for matches, needs to check length * 2 + 2 groups (5 rows, 5 columns, 2 diagonals)
