# bingo
Lifetime/Made For TV Movie bingo game I created for the inventor of this game (my sister). 

My goal with this bingo project was to think about the implementation and structure of the program before constructing it. Eventually I want to collect data on the squares clicked to determine the distribution of each bingo tile phrase throughout the made for tv movie canon. I’d like to be able to test new phrases to see if they occur frequently enough to join the list of phrases my sister has already determined meet the threshold for inclusion (she is a statistician) and choose phrases to be assigned to the tiles based on the likelihood of those phrases to occur during a typical made for tv movie, thus attempting to control the level of difficulty of bingo. 

Make-it-work-then-improve-it works as a strategy, but I want to get better at thinking about things conceptually before building them. That said, I am just starting the project so my code is sloppy right now. Don’t judge me too harshly, future employers.
